# Zomato Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the Zomato Data Analysis Project! This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) of restaurant data to gain insights into customer preferences, restaurant ratings, order behaviors, and more. The findings aim to help Zomato and its partners understand trends and make data-driven decisions.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze Zomato's restaurant and customer data to uncover patterns and insights, such as the most popular types of restaurants, average spending behavior, and customer preferences for online vs. offline orders.

### Key Objectives:

1. Identify the types of restaurants from which the majority of customers order.
2. Analyze customer votes for different restaurant types.
3. Determine the typical rating distribution among restaurants.
4. Understand the average spending behavior of couples ordering online.
5. Compare ratings between online and offline orders.
6. Find out which restaurant types receive more offline orders.

## Key Findings

1. **Restaurant Type Popularity**: The majority of customers prefer dining restaurants, indicating a strong preference for sit-down dining experiences.
2. **Customer Votes**: Dining restaurants have received the highest number of votes from users, highlighting their popularity.
3. **Rating Distribution**: Most restaurant ratings fall between 3.5 and 4 stars, with 4 stars being the most common. This suggests high customer satisfaction.
4. **Order Value**: While the maximum ticket size is ₹950, most orders are in the ₹300 range, indicating that customers often opt for affordable meal options.
5. **Average Spending for Couples**: The average cost for two people dining out is approximately ₹418.
6. **Mode of Ordering**: Online orders receive more positive ratings than offline orders, showing customer appreciation for the convenience and options provided online.
7. **Order Preferences**: Dining restaurants tend to have more offline orders, while cafes receive more online orders. This indicates a preference for in-person dining at traditional restaurants and online ordering at cafes.
